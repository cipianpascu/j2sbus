/**
 * A simple non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock.
 * The lock is free upon construction. Each acquire gets the
 * lock, and each release frees it. Releasing a lock that
 * is already free has no effect.
 * 
 * This implementation makes no attempt to provide any fairness
 * or ordering guarantees. If you need them, consider using one of
 * the Semaphore implementations as a locking mechanism.
 * 
 * <b>Sample usage</b><br>
 * 
 * Mutex can be useful in constructions that cannot be
 * expressed using java synchronized blocks because the
 * acquire/release pairs do not occur in the same method or
 * code block. For example, you can use them for hand-over-hand
 * locking across the nodes of a linked list. This allows
 * extremely fine-grained locking, and so increases
 * potential concurrency, at the cost of additional complexity and
 * overhead that would normally make this worthwhile only in cases of
 * extreme contention.
 *

 * class List {
 *     protected Node head; // pointer to first node of list
 *

 *         Node p = getHead();

 *         for (;;) {
 *             if (x.equals(p.item)) {
